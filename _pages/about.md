Welcome to my (new) academic webpage (work in progress)! I am an **economist**, currently working as an ALM Analyst at [Risk Software Technologies](https://www.riskturk.com/EN/). I obtained my master's degree in economics from [Toulouse School of Economics](http://tse-fr.eu/) in 2023, after graduating from [Bogazici University](https://econ.bogazici.edu.tr/) with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2021.

I am interested in **development economics**. I have worked on projects concerning industrialization, regional development, and consequences of education reform. My current work aims at understanding **economic roots of ethnic tensions** in Turkey and evaluating related policy interventions. You can find further information about my background and research through relevant pages.

For the R and STATA **codes for some of my graduate projects**, you can visit my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/bkbasdil).

Feel free to connect with me via [kaanbasdil@gmail.com](mailto:kaanbasdil@gmail.com)
