## Motivations: Industrial Policy and Strategic Competition

This research introduces a **dynamic game-theoretic model** to study how **governments strategically use industrial policy (IP) to build export competitiveness** under international rivalry and policy uncertainty.

### The Reinterpretation of Comparative Advantage

Traditional Ricardian theory suggests countries should specialize in sectors where they already have a comparative advantage. However, the sequential development strategy of **East Asian countries**—first protecting, then promoting industries—highlights an effort to *build* comparative advantage over time, rather than relying solely on static endowments. This idea of **dynamic comparative advantage** has been formalized by work such as Redding (1999), which showed that selective trade policy could improve welfare by endogenizing trade patterns and growth. The economic history of nations like **South Korea** under the Heavy-Chemical Industry Drive illustrates the profound impact of such coordinated, sector-specific strategies.

### The New Era of Strategic Policy

Following the 2008 financial crisis and recent geopolitical tensions, the use of industrial and protectionist policies has surged globally, exemplified by the U.S. **CHIPS and Science Act**. This environment of **tit-for-tat protectionism** introduces a critical element: **strategy**. Policy is no longer conducted in isolation, but in response to the actions, capacities, and successes of trade rivals.

This paper addresses this gap by explicitly incorporating **strategic rivalry** into the policymaker’s problem—making the generation of dynamic comparative advantage a strategic and intertemporal game.

## Contribution to the Literature

This model contributes to two main strands of economic literature: **Industrial Policy** and **Dynamic Comparative Advantage**.

### Insights on Industrial Policy

* **Beyond Domestic Uncertainty:** Building on Hausmann and Rodrik (2003), who emphasized domestic uncertainty about which activities are profitable, this paper highlights a distinct and policy-relevant source of uncertainty: **international competitiveness under strategic rivalry**. Even if a sector becomes competitive today, rival policy responses can alter relative costs tomorrow.
* **Dynamic, State-Dependent Targeting:** Rather than treating industrial policy as a one-time intervention, the model formalizes industrial policy as a **repeated, state-dependent decision**. Governments can revise their sectoral targets in each period as relative costs evolve and rivals respond.
* **A Replicable, Tractable Framework:** In contrast to approaches that rely on exogenous historical shocks or case-specific episodes, this paper develops a **replicable, formal framework** for industrial policy in which policy choices and outcomes arise endogenously and can be compared across parameterizations and country contexts.

### Key Model Features (The Strategic Game)

The model is a **Dynamic Game** between two governments. Its features capture real-world constraints:

1. **Strategic Rivalry:** Two countries ($A$ and $B$) compete for export income over a finite set of sectors $i\in\{1,\dots,N\}$, with export success determined by **relative production costs**.
2. **Policy Implementation Uncertainty:** Industrial policy success is **stochastic ($\alpha$)**. Policy affects sectoral costs in the following period ($t+1$), so governments choose targets at time $t$ to influence export competitiveness at time $t+1$.
3. **Resource Trade-Offs (Zero-Budget Rule):** A cost reduction in one targeted sector must be offset by a corresponding cost increase in another sector, capturing the necessity of **resource withdrawal** from other parts of the economy. In the current formulation, the offset sector is chosen from among **actively exporting sectors**, so policy reallocates competitiveness within the set of current winners.
4. **State Capacity and Patience:** Structural parameters like **state capacity ($\rho$)** and **patience ($\beta$)** govern the effectiveness of interventions and the willingness to incur short-run losses for long-run export gains.
5. **Dynamic Equilibrium Outcomes:** The equilibrium describes when industrial policy is used, which sectors are targeted and sacrificed, and how strategic interaction shapes trajectories of **export upgrading**, persistence, or cycling in sectoral advantage.

The resulting **Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE)** identifies when and where industrial policy emerges, and how structural parameters determine whether countries achieve economic **upgrading** or remain stuck in **low-complexity specialization** under strategic rivalry and uncertainty.
