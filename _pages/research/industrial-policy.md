## Motivations: Industrial Policy and Strategic Competition

This research introduces a **dynamic game-theoretic model** to study how **governments strategically use industrial policy (IP) to build export competitiveness** in the face of international rivalry and uncertainty.

### The Reinterpretation of Comparative Advantage

Traditional Ricardian theory suggests countries should specialize in sectors where they already have a comparative advantage. However, the sequential development strategy of **East Asian countries**—first protecting, then promoting industries—highlights an effort to *build* a comparative advantage over time, rather than relying solely on static endowments. This idea of **dynamic comparative advantage** has been formalized by work such as Redding (1999), which showed that selective trade policy could improve welfare by endogenizing trade patterns and growth. The economic history of nations like **South Korea** under the Heavy-Chemical Industry Drive illustrates the profound impact of such a coordinated, sector-specific strategy.

### The New Era of Strategic Policy

Following the 2008 financial crisis and recent geopolitical tensions, the use of industrial and protectionist policies has surged globally, exemplified by the U.S. **CHIPS and Science Act**. This environment of **tit-for-tat protectionism** introduces a critical element: **strategy**. Policy is no longer conducted in isolation, but in response to the actions, capacities, and successes of trade rivals.

This paper addresses this gap by expanding the policymaker's problem to include **strategic rivalry**—making the generation of dynamic comparative advantage a true game.

## Contribution to the Literature

This model contributes to two main strands of economic literature: Industrial Policy and Dynamic Comparative Advantage.

### Insights on Industrial Policy

* **Beyond Information Elicitation:** Building on Hausmann and Rodrik (2003), who saw IP as a tool to alleviate domestic cost uncertainty, this paper introduces a new source of uncertainty: **international competitiveness**. The government's role transforms from alleviating domestic investment risks to assessing a sector's *relative* cost against a strategic rival in export markets.
* **A Public Sector as an Information Aggregator:** The model formalizes the government's role in addressing its informational shortcomings (Rodrik, 2004) by observing past trade outcomes, updating its **beliefs** about future competitiveness, and using IP as a tool to act on those beliefs.
* **A Replicable Framework:** In contrast to much of the recent literature, which uses exogenous policy shocks like the Napoleonic blockade (Juhász, 2018) or specific historical case studies (Lane, 2022), this research develops a **replicable, formal model** of industrial policy implementation that can generate insights applicable across different country contexts.

### Key Model Features (The Strategic Game)

The model is a **Dynamic Game** between two governments. Its features capture real-world constraints:

1.  **Strategic Rivalry:** Two countries ($A$ and $B$) compete for export income over a continuum of goods, with success determined by **relative production costs**.
2.  **Uncertainty and Beliefs:** The success of industrial policy is **stochastic ($\alpha$)**, and the government acts based on **beliefs ($p_j(x,t)$)**—the perceived probability of achieving export success in a targeted sector.
3.  **Resource Trade-Offs (Zero-Budget Rule):** A cost reduction in one targeted sector ($x^\star$) must be offset by a corresponding cost increase in another sector ($x^{\text{offset}}$). This captures the necessity of **resource withdrawal** from other parts of the economy.
4.  **State Capacity and Patience:** Structural parameters like **state capacity ($\rho$)** and **patience ($\beta$)** determine a country's ability to successfully transform its economy.
5.  **Firm Reallocation:** Firm distribution across sectors is **endogenous**, shifting towards products that generated export income in the previous period, reinforcing successful policy interventions.

The resulting **Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE)** identifies when and where industrial policy emerges, and how structural parameters determine whether countries achieve economic **upgrading** or remain stuck in **development traps** by optimally specializing in low-complexity products.
