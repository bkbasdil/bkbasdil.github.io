"...near things are more related than distant things" - from Tobler's first law of geography.

Although recent work has shed light on the extent of regional inequality in Turkey, there is limited understanding on the distribution of and changes in industrial activity over time. By understanding where and why industrial activity emerges, it is possible to pursue place-based policies aiming at fostering economic activity and mediating regional inequality. **This study** aims at understanding the distribution of industrial activity in Turkey since 1927. The study utilizes a rich historical dataset of manufacturing censuses and surveys, covering the number of industrial establishments, number of workers employed (paid or unpaid), inputs and outputs per firm, energy consumption, and so on. The study will strive to identify how industrial location is driven by market potential, endowments (proximity to land, energy sources, human capital), state factories and fiscal incentives.

My role in the study consists of preparing digitized data for analysis, identifying issues within data, evaluating data estimation strategies, digitizing data where required, and conducting preliminary analyses on the prepared data. My programming language of choice in this project is R.
Here is a glimpse of what we are trying to understand. The graph on the left illustrates the distribution of (log1p-transformed) industrial establishments in Turkey. The immediate observation, that industrial activity is more prevalent in the West than East, mirrors the east-west inequality documented in the recent literature. Furthermore, the evolution of value-added across cities suggests significant growth in urban giants may be the primary source of industrial inequality in Turkey.
