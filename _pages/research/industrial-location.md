      Although recent work has shed light on the extent of regional inequality in Turkey, there remains a
      <strong>limited understanding of the distribution and evolution of industrial activity</strong> over time.
      Understanding where and why industrial activity emerges is central to the design of place-based policies
      aimed at fostering economic development and mitigating regional disparities.

    <p>
      This study <strong>aims to understand the spatial distribution of industrial activity in Turkey since 1927</strong>.
      It draws on a rich historical dataset of manufacturing censuses and surveys, covering the number of industrial
      establishments, employment (paid and unpaid), firm-level inputs and outputs, energy use, and related indicators.
      The analysis examines how industrial location responds to market potential, factor endowments (such as proximity
      to land, energy sources, and human capital), the presence of state-owned factories, and fiscal incentives.

      <strong>This figure illustrates the core empirical question of the project.</strong>
      The map on the left shows the distribution of industrial establishments across Turkey in 1927,
      using log(1 + establishments) to improve comparability. The immediate concentration of industrial
      activity in the western regions mirrors the east–west inequality documented in the recent literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evolution of value added across cities further suggests that growth in large urban centers may
      be a primary driver of long-run industrial inequality. <strong>My role in the project</strong> includes
      digitizing historical sources, identifying and resolving data inconsistencies, evaluating estimation
      strategies, and conducting preliminary empirical analyses. All data processing and analysis are carried
      out in <strong>R</strong>.
