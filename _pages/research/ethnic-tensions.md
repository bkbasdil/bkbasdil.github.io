      This project investigates the <strong>economic roots of ethnic tensions in Turkey</strong> and 
      the role of state-led development in shaping regional disparities. Spatial inequalities in income, 
      infrastructure, and public goods access have long been associated with the “Kurdish Question,” yet 
      quantitative evidence on the causal links between economic conditions and political behavior remains limited. 
      By combining historical industrial data, high-resolution satellite imagery, and electoral outcomes, 
      this research sheds light on how development patterns influence both social cohesion and political dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project consists of two essays, each addressing distinct but related research questions. 
      The first essay examines whether <strong>uneven industrial development in the early 1980s</strong>—four years 
      before the onset of insurgency—contributed to anti-establishment voting in Eastern Turkey. 
      The second essay evaluates the impact of the <em>Güneydoğu Anadolu Projesi</em> (Southeastern Anatolia Project, GAP) 
      on local economic activity and political outcomes from 1992 to 2023, using night-time lights as a proxy for income. 
      The novelty of this work lies in linking historical development patterns and modern infrastructure interventions 
      to long-run political and economic trajectories at the subnational level.

  <p>
    Analysis of night-time lights reveals persistent regional disparities in economic activity. 
    Eastern and Southeastern provinces, despite improvements following the GAP investments, continue 
    to lag behind the western regions in overall luminosity, suggesting that infrastructure alone 
    is insufficient to fully close long-standing development gaps. This pattern is consistent with 
    historical industrial distributions and supports the first essay’s finding that pre-existing 
    economic marginalization is strongly correlated with anti-establishment political behavior. 
    By quantifying the spatial distribution of economic activity over time, the study provides 
    a clear empirical link between development policy, persistent inequality, and ethnic tensions in Turkey.
