      This project examines the <strong>economic roots of ethnic tensions in Turkey</strong> and the consequences 
      of state-led development interventions. The “Kurdish Question” has long been associated with 
      <strong>regional and inter-ethnic inequality</strong>, but little quantitative work has investigated its 
      economic underpinnings.

      The research consists of two essays. The first investigates whether uneven industrial development in 1980 
      – four years before the onset of insurgency – contributed to anti-establishment voting in Eastern Turkey. 
      The second evaluates the impact of the <em>Güneydoğu Anadolu Projesi</em> (Southeastern Anatolia Project), 
      a massive infrastructure initiative announced in 1989, on local income (using night lights) and political 
      outcomes between 1992 and 2023.
