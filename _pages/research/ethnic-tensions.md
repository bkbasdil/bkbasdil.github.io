<!-- Preamble -->
<p>
This project examines the <strong>economic roots of ethnic tensions in Turkey</strong> and the consequences of state-led development interventions. The “Kurdish Question” has long been associated with <strong>regional and inter-ethnic inequality</strong>, but little quantitative work has investigated its economic underpinnings.
</p>

<!-- Research questions / essay novelties -->
<p>
The first essay will examine the <strong>district-level distribution of industrial activity in Turkey in 1980</strong>, four years before the beginning of the Kurdish insurgency, and nine years before the announcement of the Project's master plan. The essay will then <strong>associate anti-establishment voting in Eastern Turkey with various measures of economic inequality</strong>. This will be the first district-level analysis of the economic roots of the Kurdish Question, and contributes to the empirical literature on the causes of ethnic conflict. The results of this analysis will be suggestive regarding understanding causes of ethnic tensions in developing countries and allow a more informed policy design aiming at mediating ethnic conflict.
</p>

<p>
The second essay aims at <strong>measuring the impact of the Project on district-level per capita income and anti-establishment voting</strong>. To this end, it will <strong>generate estimates of district-level per capita income using night light data</strong>, and measure the impact of the Project on district-level per capita income and political outcomes. This will be the first analysis of the Project’s impact, both in terms of welfare and political effects. The estimates will inform understanding of the longevity of the insurgency and the types of policies that can mediate ethnic tensions. This analysis contributes to the literature on economic interventions, civil conflict, and nation-building policies.

<!-- Results paragraph -->
<p>
This plot illustrates the <strong>distribution of (log-transformed) night light data across districts in Turkey for 1992</strong>, the earliest year for which data exists. The immediate observation is that the right-hand side of the plot is darker. Since the Kurdish population is also situated in the Eastern-Southeastern parts of Turkey, <strong>there is overlap between economic backwardness and the settlement of the Kurdish population</strong>. This plot may be illustrative of the economic roots of the Kurdish Question, although no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Furthermore, <strong>three night light "hotspots" seem to emerge</strong>: The first hotspot, on the top left corner of the plot, concerns Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey in terms of population and income, and its surroundings. The second, located on the left-hand side of the plot, is Izmir, a historical port city. The third, at the center of the plot, is Ankara, the nation's capital. None of these hotspots are located in the Eastern part of Turkey, supporting the above point.
