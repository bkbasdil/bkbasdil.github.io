<!-- Preamble -->
<p>
This project examines the <strong>economic roots of ethnic tensions in Turkey</strong> and the consequences of state-led development interventions. The “Kurdish Question” has long been associated with <strong>regional and inter-ethnic inequality</strong>, but little quantitative work has investigated its economic underpinnings.
</p>

<!-- Research questions / essay novelties -->
<p>
The research consists of two essays. The first investigates whether uneven industrial development in 1980 – four years before the onset of insurgency – contributed to anti-establishment voting in Eastern Turkey. The second evaluates the impact of the <em>Güneydoğu Anadolu Projesi</em> (Southeastern Anatolia Project), a massive infrastructure initiative announced in 1989, on local income (using night lights) and political outcomes between 1992 and 2023.

<!-- Results paragraph -->
<p>
Analysis of night lights shows that the GAP Project significantly increased local illumination intensity in targeted provinces relative to non-targeted areas. The spatial distribution of development is concentrated along the main rivers and irrigation zones, indicating strong heterogeneity in the economic impact of state-led interventions. These patterns provide a visual confirmation of the unequal economic development that may underlie regional tensions.
